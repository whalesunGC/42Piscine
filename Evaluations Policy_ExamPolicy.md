**Evaluations Policy**  
The evaluations are a sacred time of 42's pedagogy; it's your duty to make them as rigorous as possible.    
The evaluations are assigned randomly. Manipulating the system to select specific evaluators is strictly forbidden. 

An evaluation must cover all the aspects required by the evaluation sheet. Even in the case of a retry of a project with minor modifications.   

It is prohibited to be evaluated with the goal of generating or give evaluation points. 

Doing evaluations on another support than the evaluee's computer is forbidden (unless required by the project)  

The ONLY way evaluations should be conducted at 42 Singapore:   
At the time of the evaluation, the evaluator goes to the computer of the evaluated student(s). The evaluation only begins when all the students in the evaluated group are present, and they need to stay during the entire evaluation. 
The evaluator opens a new private navigation tab on the computer of the evaluee and logs on the intranet.   
The evaluator clones the repository on the evaluated group's computer.  
The evaluator uses the evaluation's instructions as a guide to check the project's conformity. While doing that, the evaluator asks questions and makes sure the evaluator is the author of the code and can explain it, as well as justify the choices he made.    
The evaluator fills out the evaluation sheet either gradually or at the end of the evaluation.  
At the end, the evaluator writes a comment. 
Both the evaluator and the evaluees review the evaluation sheet (including the comment) and click "submit" only if both the evaluees and the evaluator agree.   
In the event that any established rules are not adhered to or are misused in any manner, appropriate sanctions will be enforced to maintain the integrity and fairness of the evaluations.
