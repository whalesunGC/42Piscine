Backup of my Piscine journey

Hello there!

Welcome to my written journey of my Piscine experience

Day 1
-First day, did minimal setup and didnt push myself.

-Realized the tricky nature of the exercises, really requires one to read questions and instructions very carefully.

-Overconfidence is a thing, until ex04 where i hit a wall haha.


Day 2
Clock in time : 1023hrs

Clock out time : 1930hrs

-Lets Go!

-Learned alot from **redacted** Mu, an experienced software engineer. Told me he took this up to learn C and even took a month off work. The spirit to better is craft is inspiring.

-Many interesting tidbits, the AI marker checks time using Paris time. Meaning your local time will be off when time manipulating files/dir. Makes me consider how scripts we write for production code serving different servers can screw up because of this. Seems trivial but the consequences can be dire at scale.

-Had to pack up earlish, need sleep. Promised myself I will be in bed before 10pm from now.

-The diversity of the people in the Piscine is amazing. People self select for a crazy trial like this, feels like a std div difference in oddities and talent.

Day 3!
