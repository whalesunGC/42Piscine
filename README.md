Backup of my Piscine journey

Hello there!

Welcome to my written journey of my Piscine experience

Day 1
-First day, did minimal setup and didnt push myself.
-Realized the tricky nature of the exercises, really requires one to read questions and instructions very carefully.
-Overconfidence is a thing, until ex04 where i hit a wall haha.
