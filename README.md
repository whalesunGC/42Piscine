# 42Piscine
Backup of my Piscine journey

Hello there!

Welcome to my written journey of my Piscine experience

**Day 1 WK00**  
-First day, did minimal setup and didnt push myself.    
-Realized the tricky nature of the exercises, really requires one to read questions and instructions very carefully.    
-Overconfidence is a thing, until ex04 where i hit a wall haha.     


**Day 2 WK00**  
Clock in time : 1023hrs 
Clock out time : 1930hrs    
-Lets Go!   
-Learned alot from M**redacted**, an experienced software engineer. Told me he took this up to learn C and even took a month off work. The spirit to better is craft is inspiring.  
-Many interesting tidbits, the AI marker checks time using Paris time. Meaning your local time will be off when time manipulating files/dir. Makes me consider how scripts we write for production code serving different servers can screw up because of this. Seems trivial but the consequences can be dire at scale.    
-Had to pack up earlish, need sleep. Promised myself I will be in bed before 10pm from now. 
-The diversity of the people in the Piscine is amazing. People self select for a crazy trial like this, feels like a std div difference in oddities and talent.     

**Day 3 WK00** 
Clock in time : 1330hrs 
Clock out time : 2100hrs    

-Really like the experience of evaluating others. Find it to great practice in communications and learning as well. Theres so much to learn from everyone.  
-Of note today **redacted** from Indo is a persistent coder. He goes deep and reads the man documents to understand how the code works. This is great because it forces deeper learning.    
-F**redacted** damn son, I really clicked with him. There's this ease to the conversations that only army buddies can know. He knows his stuff too. 
-T**Redacted** is amazing, super helpful and guided many fellow students through deep valleys of fog. He goes in first and uncovers the FOW for us. After that he does shy away from sharing, in fact he shares openly and willingly.   

**Day 4 WK00**  
Clock in time: 0912hrs 
Clock out time: 1711hrs

-running on 3.5hrs of sleep after the brutal bike ride home last night. Decided not to pursue this foolhardy path to an early grave :P. 
-spent today napping and doing evals for other. 
-find it to be a great learning experience especially when I have yet to complete the assignments. It is important to know the questions and what are the important criteria that the bot will mark against.    
-sociallized and interacted alot more today. Met and introduced myself to 13 new people! Learned alot about the people in this cohort, feeling more invested in this community. 
-There was a convo about why the staff at 42SG will not answer basic questions like "why does my PC not have VScode or why is there a Japanese Keyboard installed by default?" This caused quite a bit of grief with the Pisciners. I didnt understand as well but after giving it some thought I think the rational is one of pragmatism. In future when we are out in the real world, we will be using systems that are not configured to our liking. A common problem for devs is the reliance on VSCode as their text editior. Well news flash!! That aint avaiable on headless systems running 90% of the internet. The requirement to instill problem solving skills and a up by your own bootstrap attitude is crucial to develop early. Just my hot take on the pedagogy.   

**Day 5 WK00**  
EXAM DAY!!!
Clock in time: 0815hrs  
Clock out time:1648hrs  

-Nothing on my mind yet, just the anxiety of facing a 4hr exam without the internet.    
-took longer than expected to create the header file and manage the environment variable in .zshrc. 
-feeling the pressure from the lack of time with C00, moved to pointers in C01 for a bit.   

AAR Exam C00
-Lots of false errors from Pisciners here. From failed login, not starting examshell and confusion on login post running examshell. Think it makes sense to prepare a small help reminder markdown and pin it.  
-Got to problem #5 by sheer doggedness and looking at local sample code.    
-Totally stuck at ft_putstr which required knowledge I did not have.    
-Tried a total of 7 times, by the 6th attempt the grademe window balloned to >30mins which is useful to know.   
-Will recode my implementations here for upload after Rush00, leaving it as practice and for the progeny.   

**Day 6 WK00**  
Clock in time: 1015hrs  
Clock out time: 1720hrs 

-Rush00! Super lucky and got the supreme leader as my group IC. T**redacted** quicly setup a slack channel and officiated the procedures for the team project. He communicated reasonable and firm commitments for the group to exist, which made the path forward clear. Learned to clearly define milestones for the project early as a way to lead the conversation on contributions and create escape hatches for everyone to bow out.  
-Spent alot of time in evalations today. Met D**redacted**u again which was a real joy. Seeing him work helps establish an idea of what good looks like in terms of setup and coding best practices. As an aside, the philosophical discussion is a wonder gift, hard to receive in kind for me.    
-Rush00 cant compile for me for some reason I havent troubleshooted. The norm also produces header errors for .c files when before no such error was produced, weird.   

**Day 7 WK00**  
Clock in time: 0900hrs  
Clock out time: 1600hrs 

-**Thought about rushing in the mornings this week. Realized I have been abrasive to my family and strangers during the morning rush to campus. Part of it is the adrenaline from being in a competitive entrance exam, another is nerves. Giving it some thought this morning as I rode my bicycle to the train station, that my frustrations with pedestrians etc ,people that get in MY WAY, are real but misguided. It puts me in a sour mood that simply spreads animosity, since people are important to me I want to be respectful to everyone. The world does not revolve around the individual, we merely exist within it.**   

-Came into the campus with 3 evals for today! yay! the tactic to leave slots the day before open has proven useful. 
-I will then close my window if I am satisfied with my evaluator workload for the day :).   

-Completed Rush00 with the team virtually. Boss T**redacted** created a Discord Channel for us to sync up. Its superior to Zoom for our usecase as it can be used fully featured on a Web Browser. That means video calls and screen share on 42 computers. Genius!    

**Day 8 WK01** 
Clock in time: 0820hrs 
Clock out time: 1900hrs    

-We have booked out Rush00 defence on the first slot, which is 1300hrs today.  
-I will focus on pushing C01 today and starting with C02. 
-Cleared Rush00 with the fantastic team, couldnt ask for more from them.   
-T**redacted** was our evaluator and he made two great points with regard to the 42 pedogogy.  
-"Play with your code" 
-"Do not write code you do not understand" 
-This is to ensure we really know what the functions we call are doing under the hood. 

**Day 9 WK01** 
Clock in time: 0850hrs 
Clock out time:    

-Goals for today: 1) Submit C01 2) Finish C02 3) Start C03  
-Submitted C01, somehow local tests pass but it fails to compile on Fr Server?? 
-Moving on to C02   
-Actually not too bad, C02 really tests our ability to build on previous functions. 
-The key here is ASCII table familiarity(Deci and Hex systems) and string manipulation. 
-Spend the better part of the day working through ex00 - ex10.  
-Will push for evaluation now, currently 1750hrs.  
-Decided to focus on testing and reading C03 for tomorrow.    

**Day 10 WK01** 
Clock in time: 1351hrs   
Clock out time:1900hrs 

-Gonna be later today, did testing of C01 on the personal system. Pushing up to repo and will pull it later for upload to
intra.   
-For some reason the .md file is edited in VIM on my local VSCODE, curious...  
-Found out what "Misaligned variable declaration" means. I always get this error when declaring different data types. The code will compile but norm doesnt like it. Turns out the column of the var name needs to be the same, go figure! 

**Day 11 WK01** 
Clock in time: 0900hrs   
Clock out time:1800hrs  

-Goals for today : C03 Submission , C04 Submission, Start C05.  
-Side note, managed to extract the photos and videos from my iPhone backup. Saving me alot of grief! I found a repo written in java that does the job cleanly and its opensource!   
-S**Redacted** Chicken Rice stall starts selling 0950hrs onwards!   
-Damn got a fail for C03, need to look at ex01, 04 and 05.  

**Day 12 WK01** 
Clock in time: 1035hrs   
Clock out time:1745hrs  

-Goals : C04-ex03 C05-ex02 C06 by 1400hrs.     

**Day 13 WK01** 
Clock in time: 0949hrs   
Clock out time:hrs  

-Exam was frustrating, spent 2.5hrs on ft_atoi. It really showed the gaps in my knowledge on syntax and pointers. Especially int and char comparisions. How to do it effectively, efficiently and without tons of variable. Useful to have failed there, time to improve. Fail fast, fail forwad.   
-Managing Rush01 will be interesting, lets see how this goes... lol 
-My other takeaways from the exam.  
(1) Learn printf and stdio.h for testing.   
(2) Practice writing tests from scratch.    
(3) Initializing strings into a char array. 
-Learning malloc today from AI chatbots, I find asking them conceptual questions to be much faster than using stackoverflow or reddit.  The answers tend to be formatted and written far clearer. There is something to be said about the hallucination though. I have already experienced GPT providing code that made errorneous assumptions from my input.   
-malloc is an interesting toy, it introduced the idea of different memory types in c, stacked, heap and static. The fundamentals concept is fairly interesting. Why did the authors decide to have the ability to allocate memory at runtime vs compile? Why the need for memory management? Dynamic memory allocation is useful clearly for unknown input sizes / data, especially in tree searches or data input. 

**Day 14 WK02** 
Clock in time: NAhrs   
Clock out time:NAhrs

-food poisining from rancid peanuts. GG.    
-rested at home for the day.

**Day 15 WK02**
Clock in time: 1335hrs  
Clock out time: hrs 

-Decided to work from home today instead of going down to campus.      
-Better get a mid Piscine reset sooner than later.  
-Did as much of my overdue chores/tasks/projects as I can.   
-Will focus on clearing the backlog C00 today and trying our the mini-minonette program locally.    

**Day 16 WK02**
Clock in time: 0830hrs  
Clock out time: 1955hrs 

-cont'd with C00 ex05, plans for yesterday fell thru.   
-did CC00 ex05 - ex07.
-took longer than expected argh.... 

**Day 17 WK02**
Clock in time: 0915hrs  
Clock out time: 2130hrs 

-started the day with C00ex08, gettin hit by the enormous wall. Needs recursion.   
-cleaned up C00 and C03 again, made multiple tries to clear the errors.   

**Day 18 WK02**
Clock in time: 0440hrs  
Clock out time: 2000hrs 
-was productive the past 2 days, imho.  Been frustrated with the eval and failure loops that burns time. Realizing that the learning changes in these loops. I learn about my carelessness in shipping code, lack of adequate testing and fatigue from jumping through questions making more unforced errors.   
-The precision of the learning is also tested with similar concepts in different forms. It asks "Do you really know what is being communicated to the compiler?"    
-Blizting through the problems is an effective strategy to cover ground before an exam. But to do well holistically, it requires optimizing my creation process. TDD may be the answer to this since the pain from eval loops come from the long cycles of feedback.    

**Day 19 WK02** 
Clock in time: 0850hrs  
Clock out time: 1700hrs 
-Exam day, feeling anxious. Under prepared for sure, untouched malloc, and got stuck clear backlogs this week plus sickness.    
-Resting yesterday was a good call, feel mental clarity today. Will need to lean in hard and focus on revision. 
-Will take the first 2hrs to focus on C07 or Malloc. Get the gist down and complete some exercises. 
-From 12pm - 5pm i will focus on revision, argc argv, recursion and usage of stdio for testing. 

**Day 21 WK03** 
Clock in time: 1223hrs  
Clock out time: hrs 
-Sunday extra time, planning to do evals today. Aim to clear up to C06. 
-cleared evals to C04.
-takes me about half a day to clear evals.
