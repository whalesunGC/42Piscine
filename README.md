Backup of my Piscine journey

Hello there!

Welcome to my written journey of my Piscine experience

Day 1
-First day, did minimal setup and didnt push myself.
-Realized the tricky nature of the exercises, really requires one to read questions and instructions very carefully.
-Overconfidence is a thing, until ex04 where i hit a wall haha.

Day 2
Clock in time : 1023hrs
Clock out time : 
-Lets Go!
