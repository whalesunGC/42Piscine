Backup of my Piscine journey

Hello there!

Welcome to my written journey of my Piscine experience

Day 1 WK00  
-First day, did minimal setup and didnt push myself.    
-Realized the tricky nature of the exercises, really requires one to read questions and instructions very carefully.    
-Overconfidence is a thing, until ex04 where i hit a wall haha.     


Day 2 WK00  
Clock in time : 1023hrs 
Clock out time : 1930hrs    
-Lets Go!   
-Learned alot from M**redacted**, an experienced software engineer. Told me he took this up to learn C and even took a month off work. The spirit to better is craft is inspiring.  
-Many interesting tidbits, the AI marker checks time using Paris time. Meaning your local time will be off when time manipulating files/dir. Makes me consider how scripts we write for production code serving different servers can screw up because of this. Seems trivial but the consequences can be dire at scale.    
-Had to pack up earlish, need sleep. Promised myself I will be in bed before 10pm from now. 
-The diversity of the people in the Piscine is amazing. People self select for a crazy trial like this, feels like a std div difference in oddities and talent.     

Day 3 WK00 
Clock in time : 1330hrs 
Clock out time : 2100hrs    

-Really like the experience of evaluating others. Find it to great practice in communications and learning as well. Theres so much to learn from everyone.  
-Of note today **redacted** from Indo is a persistent coder. He goes deep and reads the man documents to understand how the code works. This is great because it forces deeper learning.    
-F**redacted** damn son, I really clicked with him. There's this ease to the conversations that only army buddies can know. He knows his stuff too. 
-T**Redacted** is amazing, super helpful and guided many fellow students through deep valleys of fog. He goes in first and uncovers the FOW for us. After that he does shy away from sharing, in fact he shares openly and willingly.   

Day 4 WK00  
Clock in time: 0912hrs 
Clock out time: 1711hrs

-running on 3.5hrs of sleep after the brutal bike ride home last night. Decided not to pursue this foolhardy path to an early grave :P. 
-spent today napping and doing evals for other. 
-find it to be a great learning experience especially when I have yet to complete the assignments. It is important to know the questions and what are the important criteria that the bot will mark against.    
-sociallized and interacted alot more today. Met and introduced myself to 13 new people! Learned alot about the people in this cohort, feeling more invested in this community. 
-There was a convo about why the staff at 42SG will not answer basic questions like "why does my PC not have VScode or why is there a Japanese Keyboard installed by default?" This caused quite a bit of grief with the Pisciners. I didnt understand as well but after giving it some thought I think the rational is one of pragmatism. In future when we are out in the real world, we will be using systems that are not configured to our liking. A common problem for devs is the reliance on VSCode as their text editior. Well news flash!! That aint avaiable on headless systems running 90% of the internet. The requirement to instill problem solving skills and a up by your own bootstrap attitude is crucial to develop early. Just my hot take on the pedagogy.   

Day 5 WK00  
EXAM DAY!!!
Clock in time: 0815hrs  
Clock out time:1648hrs  

-Nothing on my mind yet, just the anxiety of facing a 4hr exam without the internet.    
-took longer than expected to create the header file and manage the environment variable in .zshrc. 
-feeling the pressure from the lack of time with C00, moved to pointers in C01 for a bit.   

AAR Exam C00
-Lots of false errors from Pisciners here. From failed login, not starting examshell and confusion on login post running examshell. Think it makes sense to prepare a small help reminder markdown and pin it.  
-Got to problem #5 by sheer doggedness and looking at local sample code.    
-Totally stuck at ft_putstr which required knowledge I did not have.    
-Tried a total of 7 times, by the 6th attempt the grademe window balloned to >30mins which is useful to know.   
-Will recode my implementations here for upload after Rush00, leaving it as practice and for the progeny.   

Day 6 WK00  
Clock in time: 1015hrs  
Clock out time: 1720hrs 

-Rush00! Super lucky and got the supreme leader as my group IC. T**redacted** quicly setup a slack channel and officiated the procedures for the team project. He communicated reasonable and firm commitments for the group to exist, which made the path forward clear. Learned to clearly define milestones for the project early as a way to lead the conversation on contributions and create escape hatches for everyone to bow out.  
-Spent alot of time in evalations today. Met D**redacted**u again which was a real joy. Seeing him work helps establish an idea of what good looks like in terms of setup and coding best practices. As an aside, the philosophical discussion is a wonder gift, hard to receive in kind for me.    
-Rush00 cant compile for me for some reason I havent troubleshooted. The norm also produces header errors for .c files when before no such error was produced, weird.   

Day 7 WK00  
Clock in time: 0900hrs  
Clock out time: 1600hrs 

-**Thought about rushing in the mornings this week. Realized I have been abrasive to my family and strangers during the morning rush to campus. Part of it is the adrenaline from being in a competitive entrance exam, another is nerves. Giving it some thought this morning as I rode my bicycle to the train station, that my frustrations with pedestrians etc ,people that get in MY WAY, are real but misguided. It puts me in a sour mood that simply spreads animosity, since people are important to me I want to be respectful to everyone. The world does not revolve around the individual, we merely exist within it.**   

-Came into the campus with 3 evals for today! yay! the tactic to leave slots the day before open has proven useful. 
-I will then close my window if I am satisfied with my evaluator workload for the day :).   

 -Completed Rush00 with the team virtually. Boss T**redacted** created a Discord Channel for us to sync up. Its superior to Zoom for our usecase as it can be used fully featured on a Web Browser. That means video calls and screen share on 42 computers. Genius!    

 Day 8 WK01 
 Clock in time: 0820hrs 
 Clock out time: 1900hrs    

 -We have booked out Rush00 defence on the first slot, which is 1300hrs today.  
 -I will focus on pushing C01 today and starting with C02. 
 -Cleared Rush00 with the fantastic team, couldnt ask for more from them.   
 -T**redacted** was our evaluator and he made two great points with regard to the 42 pedogogy.  
 -"Play with your code" 
 -"Do not write code you do not understand" 
 -This is to ensure we really know what the functions we call are doing under the hood. 

 Day 9 WK01 
 Clock in time: 0850hrs 
 Clock out time:    

-Goals for today: 1) Submit C01 2) Finish C02 3) Start C03  
-Submitted C01, somehow local tests pass but it fails to compile on Fr Server?? 
-Moving on to C02   
-Actually not too bad, C02 really tests our ability to build on previous functions. 
-The key here is ASCII table familiarity(Deci and Hex systems) and string manipulation. 
-Spend the better part of the day working through ex00 - ex10.  
-Will push for evaluation now, currently 1750hrs.  
-Decided to focus on testing and reading C03 for tomorrow.
