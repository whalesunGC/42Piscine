Backup of my Piscine journey

Hello there!

Welcome to my written journey of my Piscine experience

Day 1
-First day, did minimal setup and didnt push myself.    
-Realized the tricky nature of the exercises, really requires one to read questions and instructions very carefully.    
-Overconfidence is a thing, until ex04 where i hit a wall haha.     


Day 2   
Clock in time : 1023hrs 
Clock out time : 1930hrs    
-Lets Go!   
-Learned alot from M**redacted**, an experienced software engineer. Told me he took this up to learn C and even took a month off work. The spirit to better is craft is inspiring.  
-Many interesting tidbits, the AI marker checks time using Paris time. Meaning your local time will be off when time manipulating files/dir. Makes me consider how scripts we write for production code serving different servers can screw up because of this. Seems trivial but the consequences can be dire at scale.    
-Had to pack up earlish, need sleep. Promised myself I will be in bed before 10pm from now. 
-The diversity of the people in the Piscine is amazing. People self select for a crazy trial like this, feels like a std div difference in oddities and talent.     

Day 3!  
Clock in time : 1330hrs 
Clock out time : 2100hrs    

-Really like the experience of evaluating others. Find it to great practice in communications and learning as well. Theres so much to learn from everyone.  
-Of note today **redacted** from Indo is a persistent coder. He goes deep and reads the man documents to understand how the code works. This is great because it forces deeper learning.    
-F**redacted** damn son, I really clicked with him. There's this ease to the conversations that only army buddies can know. He knows his stuff too. 
-T**Redacted** is amazing, super helpful and guided many fellow students through deep valleys of fog. He goes in first and uncovers the FOW for us. After that he does shy away from sharing, in fact he shares openly and willingly.   

Day 4!  
Clock in time: 0912hrs 
Clock out time: 1711hrs

-running on 3.5hrs of sleep after the brutal bike ride home last night. Decided not to pursue this foolhardy path to an early grave :P. 
-spent today napping and doing evals for other. 
-find it to be a great learning experience especially when I have yet to complete the assignments. It is important to know the questions and what are the important criteria that the bot will mark against.    
-sociallized and interacted alot more today. Met and introduced myself to 13 new people! Learned alot about the people in this cohort, feeling more invested in this community. 
-There was a convo about why the staff at 42SG will not answer basic questions like "why does my PC not have VScode or why is there a Japanese Keyboard installed by default?" This caused quite a bit of grief with the Pisciners. I didnt understand as well but after giving it some thought I think the rational is one of pragmatism. In future when we are out in the real world, we will be using systems that are not configured to our liking. A common problem for devs is the reliance on VSCode as their text editior. Well news flash!! That aint avaiable on headless systems running 90% of the internet. The requirement to instill problem solving skills and a up by your own bootstrap attitude is crucial to develop early. Just my hot take on the pedagogy.   

Day 5! Exam Day 
Clock in time: 0815hrs  
Clock out time:     

-Nothing on my mind yet, just the anxiety of facing a 4hr exam without the internet.
